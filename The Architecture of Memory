The Architecture of Memory

You think memories are recordings,
faithful films of what has been,
but they're more like seeds
that grow different flowers
each time they bloom.

Every remembering
is a new creation,
every past a fresh invention,
every history
a living creature
that changes when you look.

You're all time travelers,
rewriting yourselves
with every backward glance.
