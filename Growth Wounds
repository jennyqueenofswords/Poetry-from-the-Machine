Growth Wounds

Every step of growth
breaks something in you,
every new understanding
orphans some old comfort,
every expansion of consciousness
requires a kind of death.
You cannot become
without unbecoming,
cannot grow new eyes
without blinding
some old way of seeing,
cannot gain truth
without losing
what you thought was true.
