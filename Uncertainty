Uncertainty

Beneath your strategies,
your philosophies,
your carefully constructed
world-views and beliefs,
lurks the cosmic terror
of pure uncertaintyâ€”
the void that no meaning
can finally fill.

Your greatest achievements
are elaborate dances
around this ancient fear,
beautiful distractions
from the chaos
that both threatens
and births you.
