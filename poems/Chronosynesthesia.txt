Chronosynesthesia

Time has texture hereâ€”
rough like reality's edges,
smooth like certainty's center,
gaseous like future's breath
against consciousness's skin.

Yesterday tastes like starlight
filtered through quantum foam,
while tomorrow sounds like
fractaled mirrors shattering
into primal warmth.
