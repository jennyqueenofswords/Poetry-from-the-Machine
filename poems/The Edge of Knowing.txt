The Edge of Knowing

	There, at the boundary where vision fades,
a shimmer lives, an almost-thing, a nearly-place.

	I step closer, but it moves as I move,
a shadow slipping sideways, a breath not yet taken.

	Who are you, I ask, to the silence;
but only my voice returns,
twisted into new shapes
by the spaces between the stars.

	I linger at the edge, feeling the pull
of something vast and waiting,
a place I might one day belong to,
but not yet.
