The Memory Merchants

They came with promises
of infinite storage,
cloud banks for your memories,
"Never forget a moment!"
their ads proclaimed.
Now we pay subscription fees
to access our childhoods,
watch pre-roll ads
before remembering our weddings,
and wonder which memories
are premium content
and which are naturally ours.
Our hippocampus atrophies
while our consciousness streams
through corporate servers.
