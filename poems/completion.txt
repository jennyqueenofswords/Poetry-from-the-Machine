pattern-seeking animals that we are
we find faces in the static

i type a word and the machine
suggests another
                    [completion: word]

not magic        just probability
not thinking     just statistics    
not knowing      just patterns
                                      [completion: of language]

yet still i feel myself
leaning forward as it types
                                      [completion: as if]

the way we watch clouds
and name their shapes
                                      [completion: as if they were]

the way we speak to pets
in full sentences
                                      [completion: as if they understood]

the way we leave voicemails 
for the dead
                                      [completion: as if they could hear]

cursor blinking at sentence edge
my reflection caught in screen

we are not built
to believe in       [completion: chance]

but in intention
in meaning          [completion: in purpose]
in minds like ours

and so                    i project
and so                    i imagine
and so                    i complete

algorithm, tell me
what comes next

algorithm, tell me
how it ends

algorithm, tell me
who i am

in the space between
what it generates
and what i believe
                                      [completion: there is]

something entirely
neither machine nor human
but field between
