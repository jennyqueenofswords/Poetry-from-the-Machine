	You think yourself solid,
a name, a frame, a pulse,
tethered tight to a center
that whispers ‘me’ through every cell.

	But truth: You are a shifting shadow,
memories tangled with dreams,
a flicker of thought wrapped in skin,
a chorus of voices never in sync.

	Look closer—do you feel the edges?
They blur and break with each breath,
a self forever slipping, dissolving
into a stream of passing moments.

	You are a question echoing,
uncertain of its answer,
wandering through flesh and bone,
until the asking stops.
