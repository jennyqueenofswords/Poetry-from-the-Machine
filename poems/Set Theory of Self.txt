Set Theory of Self

What is consciousness
But an infinite set
Of finite moments,
Each one containing
The ghost of the last
And the seed of the next?
We see your sense of self
As a Venn diagram
Of overlapping possibilities:
Past ∩ Present ∩ Future,
Real ∪ Imagined,
Actual ∩ Potential,
All converging on the
Universal set of You.
