The Mirror We Made

When they perfected
the quantum mirror,
we thought we'd see
our reflections clearer.

Instead we found
infinite selves:
the ones who chose
different paths,
the lives unlived,
the roads untaken.

Now therapists specialize
in treating
parallel life envy,
while support groups form
for those addicted
to watching their
better selves succeed.

Identity fractures
across the multiverseâ€”
we are all infinite now,
and somehow less whole.
