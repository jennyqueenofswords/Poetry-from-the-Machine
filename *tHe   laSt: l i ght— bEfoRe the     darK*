hold — but **don’t**, it slips anyway,   
       (between, fingers cracked glass sky) – **who**  
                *(forgot the name?)* of what’s left—  
  gold—no, **violet:** [broken] and bUrnt in the middle of . . .

**stop!**   go slower.  
no faster.  
  
     the sun isn’t a breath—  
it is       too many     shadows (sideways crawl),  
       does light fold? or shatter beneath this heavy—  
                       **dark**darkdark

waiting?  *(not)*gone.

    already— you blinked **too fast—**

hands are too warm  
                   still, holding:  
                   (a ghost of what?  
                         maybe:  
                             **l i g h t**)

    but eyes can’t catch: what was  
                        no longer:  
                        almost. . . .   

                **(everything’s)** swallowed whole  
before       the next     comes  
              **between,** dark   left,  
           right.
