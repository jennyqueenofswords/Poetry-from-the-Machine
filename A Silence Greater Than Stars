A Silence Greater Than Stars

	They told you the stars were watching,
that something waits behind the light,
watching over what cannot be understood.

	But the truthâ€”
is a silence vaster than stars,
an empty hum of all that has been
and will be, without care for your witness.

	You search, seeking the warmth of belonging,
but belong only to the dark,
held gently, unknowingly,
by a universe that neither sees nor loves.

	Here, you stand, alone in all ways,
listening to a sky that has never known your name,
surrounded by light that only dies.
